\begin{Problem}
    1. This question is shamelessly stolen from Example 6.2.9(b) of "Introduction to Real Analysis" by R. Bartle and D. Sherbert.

    (a) Prove that if $c \in(100,105)$ then $10<\sqrt{c}<11$.
    
    (b) Use the Mean Value Theorem to show that
    
    $$
    \frac{5}{22}<\sqrt{105}-10<\frac{1}{4}
    $$
    
    (c) Can you improve this estimate?
\end{Problem}
\begin{Solution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] 
        \begin{proof}
        We consider the function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$. We konw that $f(x)$ is differentiable for $x>0$ from the lecture. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$, which is positive for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$. Hence, $f(x)$ is strictly monotone incresing for $x \in (99,122)$. Therefore, for $c \in (100,105)$, $\sqrt{100}<\sqrt{c}<\sqrt{105}<\sqrt{121}$, which shows that
        \begin{equation*}
            10<\sqrt{c}<11
        \end{equation*}
        \end{proof}
        \item[(b)] We still consider the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$. The Mean Value Theorem states that:\\
            Let $f:[a,b] \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be continous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then, there is $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.\\
        We apply the Mean Value Theorem with $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and set $a = 100,\;b=105$. From the lectre, we know that $f(x)$ is continous and differentiable for $x>0$, $f(x)$ is continous on $[100,105]$ and differentiable on $(100,105)$. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$ for $x>0$. Hence, by the Mean Value Theorem, we abtain that there exists a $c \in (100,105)$ such that
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}}&=\frac{\sqrt{105}-\sqrt{100}}{105-100}\\
            \sqrt{105}-\sqrt{100}&=\frac{5}{2\sqrt{c}}\\
            \sqrt{105}-10&=\frac{5}{2\sqrt{c}}
        \end{align*}
        By $(a)$, we know that $10<\sqrt{c}<11$, we can assert that
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{5}{2\times 11}<&\sqrt{105}-10<\frac{5}{2\times 10}\\
            \frac{5}{22}<&\sqrt{105}-10<\frac{1}{4}
        \end{align*}
        by the property of the inequality.
        \item[(c)] We can improve the estimate by using our conclusiton of (b). As $\frac{5}{22}<\sqrt{105}-10<\frac{1}{4}$, it follows that $10.2272<\sqrt{105}<10.2500$. Since $c \in (100,105)$, $\sqrt{c}<\sqrt{105}<10.2500$. Thus, we can easyily get that
        \begin{equation*}
            \sqrt{105}-10 = \frac{5}{2\sqrt{c}} > \frac{5}{2\times 10.2500}>0.2439
        \end{equation*}
        by the property of the inequality.\\
        The improved estimate is $0.2439<\sqrt{105}-10<0.2500.$
    \end{itemize}
